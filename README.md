Magento Docker Manager (MDM) is a cross platform (Mac/Linux/Windows) application to run multiple, simultaneous Magento
applications on your local system via Docker. Once installed, simply select options from the available menu items to
manage your applications.

MDM's menus are **contextual**. Only applicable options are shown. For example, if a tool is not installed, you will
be prompted to install it before continuing to unlock a feature. If the application is stopped, you'll be prompted it
to start it for additional options.

MDM has 2 general audiences: 
1. End users who might use the Magento app for demos, testing/QA, or training 
2. Developers who want to develop/test locally on a Magento Cloud like env or want to configure a packaged app for
their team of end users

# MDM End Users

End users experience MDM almost entirely through the contextual menus. Below is every possible menu item with some
additional notes if appropiate. If you do not see a particular menu item, then MDM determined it's not currently appropiate.

# MDM Developers

## Configuration

## Configuration of MDM

## Configuration of an MDM app

## Development on a Mac

### 1. clone this repo

```
$ git clone https://github.com/PMET-public/mdm.git && cd mdm
```

### 2. configure additional features

```
cp .mdm_config.tmpl.sh .mdm_config.sh
```

### 3. set up your env

```
$ export debug=1 MDM_REPO_DIR=. COMPOSER_AUTH='{"github-oauth":{"github.com":"..."}}'
```

## Additional troubleshooting notes

To debug the launching script, `export debug_launcher=1`, too. This is currently a separate var because the launching script debugging output would otherwise pollute the menu output before the logging initialization can run. Also, it represents the output of the app's `<osx_appp>/Contents/Resources/script`, not the output of ~/.mdm/current/launcher because it is bundled with the app.  The launcher should not need to be debugged often because it's relatively minimal, stable code to bootstrap the app.

## Development on Linux

Since the included Travis CI and GitHub Workflow configuration use Ubuntu Bionic (18.04) for testing, you will probably also want a local version for faster feedback and debugging.

You can use the default included Vagrantfile. Remember to install the vagrant-diskzie plugin first.

```
$ vagrant plugin install vagrant-disksize
$ vagrant up
$ vagrant ssh
```

In your test vm, there's are just a few remaining setup steps.

### 1. add the default user to the docker group

```
$ sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y
$ sudo apt install docker-compose php -y
$ sudo usermod -aG docker vagrant
$ sudo shutdown -r now
```

### 2. clone this repo
